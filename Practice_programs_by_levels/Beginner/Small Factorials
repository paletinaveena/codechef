# You are asked to calculate factorials of some small positive integers.

# Input
# An integer t, 1<=t<=100, denoting the number of testcases, followed by t lines, each containing a single integer n, 1<=n<=100.

# Output
# For each integer n given at input, display a line with the value of n!

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
  n = int(input())
  fact = 1
  for j in range(1, n+1):
    fact *= j
  print(fact)
