# Write a program to find the remainder when an integer A is divided by an integer B.

# Input
# The first line contains an integer T, the total number of test cases. Then T lines follow, each line contains two Integers A and B.

# Output
# For each test case, find the remainder when A is divided by B, and display it in a new line.

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
  l = [int(x) for x in input().split(" ")]
  print(l[0]%l[1])
