# Every problem starts with a Problem Statement. It tells you in detail about the task to be solved. Usually, although not necessarily, it is accompanied with a story. 
# As a competitive programmer, it is your job to break the problem statement and figure out exactly what it is asking.
# Shivam is the youngest programmer in the world, he is just 12 years old. Shivam is learning programming and today he is writing his first program.
# Program is very simple, given two integers A and B, write a program to add these two numbers.

# Input

# This section tells you the format in which your program should receive the input.
# The first line contains an integer T, the total number of test cases. Then follow T lines, each line contains two Integers A and B.

# Output

# This section tells us the format in which our program should give the output
# For each test case, add A and B and display it in a new line.
# Take special care for the output format; everything your program prints is considered “output”, 
# so if you output some debugging statements like “Please enter T” or print something like: “The answer is: ”, this will be considered as part of your answer, 
# and because it does not satisfy the output format, it will be marked wrong, even if your answer is otherwise correct!

def total(a,b):
  print(a+b)

n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
  l = [int(x) for x in input().split(" ")]
  total(l[0], l[1])
