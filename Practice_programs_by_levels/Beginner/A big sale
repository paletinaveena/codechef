# Chef recently opened a big e-commerce website where her recipes can be bought online. 
# It's Chef's birthday month and so she has decided to organize a big sale in which grand discounts will be provided.
# In this sale, suppose a recipe should have a discount of x percent and its original price (before the sale) is p. 
# Statistics says that when people see a discount offered over a product, they are more likely to buy it. 
# Therefore, Chef decides to first increase the price of this recipe by x% (from p) and then offer a discount of x% to people.
# Chef has a total of N types of recipes. For each i (1 ≤ i ≤ N), the number of recipes of this type available for sale is quantityi, 
# the unit price (of one recipe of this type, before the x% increase) is pricei and the discount offered on each recipe of this type (the value of x) is discounti.
# Please help Chef find the total loss incurred due to this sale, if all the recipes are sold out.

# Input
# The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
# The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of recipe types.
# N lines follow. The i-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers pricei, quantityi and discounti describing the i-th recipe type.

# Output
# For each test case, print a single line containing one real number — the total amount of money lost. 
# Your answer will be considered correct if it has an absolute error less than 10-2.
